# PyBer_Analysis
analyze all the rideshare data
## Overview of the PyBer Rideshare Data Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to view different costs of rides for different type of neighbourhoods.
## Results:

Above you can see that more dense cities tend to have lower ride costs and it happens more frequently due to the higher population in urban cities.This is directly proven by the box plot below.

The image below shows that while costs may be higher in rural areas due to traveling farther distances, urban city types hold most of the market due to the amount of people needing rides in that city type. If we had more data to compare population density, I would further prove this.

The image below shows urban cities have most of the ride percentage due to population.

The image below shows that the percentage of drivers in urban city types is higher than the ride percentage or total fare percentage. This goes with the theme we have been seeing but since the percentage is higher this implies that urban city types have a saturated market for drives on ride sharing apps.

## Summary
Although we see most of the drives going to densely populated urban city types, I think there should be more incentive for drives to go to suburban city types. The reason is that they have 30% of the total fares while only having around 16% of the drivers. This means it's more common to get calls to pick-up people in suburban areas and there will be less down time.
We find the same issue with rural areas. They have 7% of the total fares but only about 3% of the drivers. Apps should try to get people who don't mind driving long distances to work in rural cities because the ratio of total fares to drives isn't too close.
Lastly, as I have been talking about for the majority of this analysis is that urban city types are densely populated in both drivers and customers needing rides. This creates an oversatured market and to solve this you need to incentivize drivers to work in other city types when possible to level the playing field.
